# Pip-GUI
Pip GUI is a GUI to interact with pip

Are you someone new to Python? New to command line? Windows user? Or anyone who really just does not want to type in commands to search for and install modules? 
The solution is only a few clicks away, with Pip GUI.

YOU WILL NEED PYTHON 3 AND PIP ALREADY INSTALLED TO USE PIP GUI

How to install: Download the code for your system (Windows or Mac and Linux), then run the Python script using a Python editor like IDLE or Visual Studio Code.

Despite how this is targeted at novice and Windows users, "double-clickable" binary versions are not available yet. Not to worry, they will be coming soon!

Keep in mind: Pip GUI will install additional dependencies tkinter and pypisearch for interface and search functionality, additional disk space may be required.

There is no such thing as bug-free software; if you encounter errors please report them in issues.

Enjoy this software
