# Pip-GUI
Pip GUI is a GUI to interact with pip

Are you someone new to Python? New to command line? Windows user? Or anyone who really just does not want to type in commands to search for and install modules? 
The solution is only a few clicks away, with Pip GUI.

YOU WILL NEED PYTHON 3 AND PIP ALREADY INSTALLED TO USE PIP GUI

How to install: Download the code for your system (Windows or Mac and Linux), then run the Python script using the terminal or your favourite code editor like IDLE.

Despite how this is targeted at novice and Windows users, "double-clickable" binary versions are not available yet. Not to worry, they will be coming soon!
