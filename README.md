# Pip-GUI
Pip GUI is a GUI to interact with pip

Are you someone new to Python?  Or anyone who really just does not want to use terminal install modules?
The solution is only a few clicks away, with Pip GUI.

# How to use source code: 
1. Download the code for your system (Windows or Mac/Linux)
2. Run the Python script however you do normally

# How to use executable: 
1. Download the executable file for your system from [releases](https://github.com/tariq-c-dev/Pip-GUI/releases/tag/Release)
2. Extract and double click on the file

Keep in mind: Pip GUI will install additional dependencies tkinter and pypisearch for interface and search functionality, it will use a small amount of disk space.

You need Python 3 with Pip alreadyto use Pip GUI. They are available at [Python.org](https://python.org/downloads/).
