# Pip-GUI
Pip GUI is a GUI to interact with pip

Are you someone new to Python? New to command line? Windows user? Or anyone who really just does not want to type in commands to search for and install modules? 
The solution is only a few clicks away, with Pip GUI.

To install this software, you can use binaries or build from source:

YOU WILL NEED PYTHON 3 AND PIP ALREADY INSTALLED TO USE PIP GUI

Source: Download the code, run setup.sh for your system (Windows or Mac and Linux) by opening the terminal and typing sh setup.sh, then run the Python script using the terminal or your favourite code editor like IDLE.

Binaries: If you are an ordinary person, this is the easiest double-click and it's done solution. As long as you already have Python and pip installed the app should take care of installation itself. Make sure to download the binairies for your Operating system (Windows, Mac or Linux).

Enjoy this software
